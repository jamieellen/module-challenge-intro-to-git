## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch? 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

1. Git is a type of version control meant to keep code being worked on 
storeed and managed. 
2. While git is used to work on the code, github is used as the cloud 
storage and management for branches and repositories.
3. We create a branch to keep code editing seperate from published code 
until approved.
4. A pull request serves as a filter through witch code is reviewed before 
published.
5. the command  used to switch branches is "git checkout" followed by the branch name wanted.
6. git fetch and merge serve as a seperate way of communicating to the repository of changes made, and seperately merges these changes in. git pull 
however, brings those changes directly to the repository. 
7. A merge conflict happens when changes are made to the same lines of code in the same branch that do not match.
8. The best way to resolve a merge conflict is to go into the conflicting files and edit manually before trying a new merge.
